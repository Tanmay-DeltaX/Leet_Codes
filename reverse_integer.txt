Input= [1,2,5]
       [2,4,1]
Output = [3,6,6]


First , the two lists are nested in another list.
And then run through a loop in which they are multiplied by the respective powers of 10 and then added to a variable.
Now we have our output value and we only have to convert it into a list.
For that:this integer is converted to a string and then run through a loop and each value is added to a list as a integer.
